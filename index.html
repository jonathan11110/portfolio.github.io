                    Hi,I am Jonathan. I am a first year student at <a href="https://www.salford.ac.uk">Salford university</a>,studying <em>Computer Science with cyberSecurity</em>
                    in the <a href="https://cse.salford.ac.uk"> <abbr title="school of computing,science and engineering">SCE</abbr></a>.
                    <br >
                    This website is being made to demonstrate my skills in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>, however it will become painfully
                    obvious that website design is not exactly my field of expertise.
                    So I decided I would make something that is highly functional as opposed to something that looks good (although I admittedly would struggle to make it look good).
                    As a whole this website primary function is to market myself towards potential employers. Since I aspire to be a <abbr title="penetration tester">pentester</abbr>, knowledge on how websites function is crucial.
                    This website will also function as a form of online <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr>. As I gain new skills and certifications I will update this website to reflect my growth.
                    <br >
                    There are currently three pages for this website. The first is the home page. This page is an introduction to the website and
                    myself and contains my education history as well as my current skills in terms of computer science.
                    The second is a webpage focused around my work experience. That page contains my up to date work experience and related qualifications
                    and skills.
                    The final page focuses primarily on my main interest, cybersecurity. It highlights which certifications I intend to
                    study for and get, as well as what projects I intend to / have completed and what skills they have given me.

                    Before College I was a student at<a href="https://fishermore.lancs.sch.uk/"><abbr title="Ss St John Fisher and Thomas Moore Roman Catholic HighSchool">fishermore</abbr></a>.
                    The Grades I achieved at GCSE level can be seen in Table 1.0. It was at the GCSE level that I truly fell in love with computer science as a subject
                    as I had a computer science teacher that allowed me to explore programming from an angle not taught in the highschool curriculum. That being the
                    creation of <abbr title="malicious software">malware</abbr>.I was able to learn how this software was able to target files on a system and attempted
                    to emulate this with pythons <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> library, to move or even delete files. I was also able to use this library
                    to begin to learn about <abbr title="Denial of Service">DOS</abbr> attacks.

                    It was here that I began to focus on cyber security as a passion, and began to learn about the weak points of systems. Including finding data breaches
                    on the staff and students shared network.

            <h1>My Skillset</h1>
            <div id="TechStack">
                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been programming for close to 5 years now. During that time I have been taught or self learnt varying programming languages
                    Below are the one's I am confident in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>C#</li>
                        <li>HTML5</li>
                        <li>java</li>
                        <li>python</li>
                        <li>linux/BASH scripts</li>
                    </ul>
                    In addition to this I am currently trying to learn the Haskell programming language.
                    <h2>General skills</h2>
                    As a result of my time being employed by <abbr title="Pendle Leisure Trust">PLT</abbr> I have gained several versatile skills.
                    From the ability to work well under pressure, to being able to communicate in a team and to customers I have learnt a lot
                    and have improved in various ways. So these general skills will be covered in the <a href="work.html"> Work experience</a> web page
