                <p>
                    Projects are an excellent way to demonstrate and practice key skills within cybersecurity and computer science as a whole
                    . This portion of the Website details projects that I have completed and what skills they demonstrate. There will also
                    be a section dedicated to ongoing or future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>Completed projects</h2>

                    <h3>Set up of virtual machine</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have set up  a virtual machine on both my laptop and desktop. This is an important tool as virtual achines allow for the testing of
                        malware and other typically harmful practices with less risk of infecting a home network. Due to the virtual machine I am now studying
                        malware analysis as well as how to locate harmful programs that have been unknowingly running on a device.

                    <h3>Simple encryption tool</h3>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is a common tool used to ensure privacy in data transfer and storage. In order to ensure I know how common methods of encryption
                        work, I created a simple program that would encrypt a given user input.
                        <br />
                        currently it only encrypts using a ceaser cipher, which is outdated and unsecure. It also stills has some bugs,including attempting to convert
                        some letters to special characters.<br />
                        The changes im going to make to this project are:
                        <ol>
                            <li>fix the current bugs</li>
                            <li>give the option to use multiple encryption algorithms</li>
                            <li>the ability to decrypt an inputted message, either with a key or via brute force ( e.g. guessing keys and checking outputs against a dictionary)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Set up and monitor a network</h3>
                    <p>
                        Networks are common targets for attacks by hacker, so knowing how to defend one has its roots in how to both set up and maintain a network.
                        Since I currently have access to a spare rooter i'm going to set up a private network with a couple of devices and learn how to do basic monitoring
                        and security e.g.defence against port scanning. By having this network set up I will also have the ability to practice methods of attack such as using <abbr title="Network Mapper">nmap</abbr>
                        and infecting devices with <abbr title="malicious software">malware</abbr>.
                    </p>

                <div class="Project">
                    <h3>Creation of a honeypot</h3>
                    <p>
                        Honey pots are a common defence tactic used against attackers that have decided to launch an attack against the network. This is a computer system with the sole purpose
                        of being sacrificed to the attacker, so it has built in security vulnerabilities and made to look valuable so that actually useful computers can remain safe. In addition to this,
                        the honey pot can be used as a means to further enhance security by allowing the network administrator to learn about what attackers are using to attack
                        the network without risking anything of value.<br />
                        This is done with varying types of honeypots such as
                        <ul>
                            <li>Email traps:these bait spam emails with harmful links so that the senders IP address can be added to a deny list</li>
                            <li>decoy databases:these bait SQL injection and help monitor software vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>malware honeypot:mimics software apps to invite malware attacks. This allows for malware analysis to be used to help develop countermeasures</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br >
                        By setting up a honeypot i will be able to use it to test means of attack, as well as ensure I am familiar with how honeypots work/look as i'm interested in
                        pen testing
