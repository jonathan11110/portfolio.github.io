                   This page is about my work experience. I have been employed since 2022 and have gained a variety of qualifications and skills 
                    as a result. So on the page below you will find all my current qualifications as well as what skills they have given me.

                <h1>LifeGuard</h1>
                <p>
                    I first became a lifeguard around September of 2022, recieving the <abbr title="National Pool Lifeguard qualification">NPLQ</abbr> Gen 9  along with
                    training in first aid and CPR. As a lifeguard, I am expected to maintain concentration for long periods
                    of time and ensure customer safety irregardless of the situation. Moreover I learnt customer service
                    skills so that I can relay expectations in regards to safety in a calm and proffesional manner.I also learnt
                    how to remain calm and effective in otherwise chaotic situations so that I can make the correct decisions.
                    <br >
                    As a first aider, my role is to reassure the customer that they will be okay and help calm them
                    down whilst performing first aid of vaeying degrees of difficulty. This not only demonstrates my
                    ability to multi task well, but further shows a high level of communication skills as I am able
                    to clearly and effectively talk to a customer suffering from varying degrees of pain.
                    <br >
                    Outside of my role of ensuring customer safety and providing first aid, I am also expected to help
                    maintain a high level of cleanliness across the building. This has helped me gain an eye for fine details
                    and an ability to work in less than pleasant environments.

                <h1>Rookie LifeGuard Instructor</h1>
                <p>
                    I have been a Rookie lifeguard instructor since the 1st of February 2025. The role of a rookie lifeguard instructor primarily focuses on
                    being able to deliver knowleedge on life seaving skills to a younger audience in a safe and effective manner whilst retaining their interest.
                    As part of this role, I learnt how to communicate expectations and knowledge to children of varying ages and varying levels of interest.
                    In addition to the increased communication skills i gained from this role, I also learned how to effectively focus on several tasks occuring
                    simultaneously, as I am expected to teach a class of several children in varying locations.
                    <br >
                    This role has also given me more insight in how to think on my feet and adapt a plan to fit the current circumstances and still produce the desired result.

            <div id="RookieRescue">
                <h1>Rookie Rescue Instructor</h1>
                <p>
                    As of the 25th of March 2025 I have become a qualified rookie rescue instructor. This course is primarily aimed at younger children with
                    disabilities that means that they otherwise would be unable to learn the skills present in the Rookie lifeguard course. As a result of
                    my training for this qualification I have learnt how to better teach children with disabilities and how to adapt pre set expectations
                    to aid the learning of crucial life saving skills.
                </p>

            <div id="SwimTeacher">
                <h1>Swim Teaching</h1>
                <p>
                    As of the 29th of March 2025, I have passed the practical and theoretical aspects of the STA award in teaching swimming. I am
                    currently waiting for my portfolio to be checked, but after that I will be an STA qualified swim teacher
                    .Through this course i have learnt how to better communicate my ideas to younger children, and have been able to learn more about how people learn
                    best. Moreover as part of the course i have completed safeguarding training for vulnerable adults and children which has helped me learn how to look out
                    for hidden signs.
                    <br >
                    In addition to this, I have gained more confidence in communicating with both children and parents on what will be covered during the lesson, as well as
                    taking control on the pacing of the lesson in order to ensure all participants are listening.
